# DailyPractice
this repository was intended to be my 30 days challenge on uploading every single day..
but turned out I can't keep up because of working two jobs..
i might still update this, but no longer in a daily basis

the purpose of this is to answer questions and challenges I found on the internet

these are the list of sources where i got the challenges and questions
